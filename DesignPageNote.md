Theatre Lights

My boyfriend and I watched our first performance of The Book of Mormon at the London's West End. 
It was a spectacle to behold.

Conjuring

Surrounded by mythical smoke, this girl appears to be conjuring dark magic by the sunset.

The Chikorita Family

Chikorita and its evolutionary line have been my
favourite Pokémon since I was young. I wanted to bring
out their playful and nuturing tendecies with this
design. p.s. Can you spot the tiny creatures hiding in
the grass land?

Vines

An interlacing of images that highlight the word’s meaning.

Balloon Dog

A fun play of light and shadow to fake the 3D effect using Photoshop.

Food Re-touching

One of my favourite things to edit is food, espeically since I
love cooking. In my edits, I love restoring the richness of
its colour to make the food look appealing and delectable.

Watercolours

A re-interpretation of my favourite food in watercolours.
These are some of the dishes that I loved to order at a
popular Japanese-Western fusion cafe back in Singapore.

Pokemon Terrarium

Inspired by my favourite childhood anime, 
an opposition of environments that portray 
the eternal strife of these legendary birds.

Camouflage

My cats used to like to hide in trees when I was young.
They almost seem to blend in...

Summer Smoothie Splash

A playful combination of elements that highlight 
the refreshing and youthful nature of the beverage.

Boat Ride

A father cat talking to his daughter as they sail under the stars. 
Done in the style of a cardboard cutout.

Playfulness

One of my first attempts of painting on Procreate. 
It looks like an in-between of a kitten and a squirrel.
